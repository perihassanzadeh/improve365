Software Design Specification: Gym Workout Tracker Web App
1. Introduction
This document details the design and architecture for a web application aimed at helping users track their daily gym workouts and nutrition. The application will provide a user-friendly interface to log activities, visualize progress, and manage personal metrics. Designed with modularity in mind, the system will allow for future expansion of features.
2. Goals and Objectives
* Primary Goal: To provide a reliable and intuitive platform for users to track their daily gym workouts and nutritional intake.
* User Engagement: Encourage consistent tracking through features like streaks and historical data visualization.
* Scalability: Design a system that can easily accommodate new features and increased user loads.
* Maintainability: Develop clean, well-structured code adhering to modern web development best practices.
* User Experience: Offer a seamless and visually appealing experience with a consistent dark mode theme.
3. User Stories
To better understand the user's needs, here are some key user stories:
* As a user, I want to see my current tracking streak on the main screen so I can stay motivated.
* As a user, I want to easily access my nutrition history, exercise history, and profile from a single menu.
* As a user, I want to view a summary of my past nutrition entries and drill down for more details.
* As a user, I want to view a summary of my past exercise entries and drill down for more details.
* As a user, I want to see my personal information, tracking streak, join date, and current metrics on my profile.
* As a user, I want the application to be in dark mode by default, with an option to toggle it off if I prefer.
4. Features
4.1 Core Functionality
* Workout Tracking: Users can log details of their daily gym workouts.
* Nutrition Tracking: Users can log details of their daily nutritional intake.
* Streak Display: Main dashboard prominently displays the user's current consecutive tracking streak (workouts or nutrition).
4.2 Navigation and History
* Top-Right Options Tab: A clickable button in the top-right corner reveals a tab with the following navigation options:
   * Nutrition History: Displays a chronological list of all days with recorded nutrition. Each day is clickable to view broader information.
   * Exercise History: Displays a chronological list of all days with recorded workouts. Each day is clickable to view broader information.
   * Profile: Navigates to the user's profile page.
4.3 User Profile
* User Details: Displays the user's name, current tracking streak, and account join date.
* Metrics: Shows current weight and height.
* Profile Picture: Allows for the display of a user-uploaded profile picture.
4.4 User Interface (UI) and Experience (UX)
* Dark Mode Theme: The entire web application will adhere to a dark mode theme across all components by default.
* Dark Mode Toggle: A button at the top of every page will allow users to toggle dark mode on/off.
* Placeholder Functionality: All clickable buttons will have a placeholder for future routing if the full functionality isn't yet implemented.
5. Technical Architecture
The application will follow standard best practices for React and full-stack development, emphasizing a modular and scalable architecture.
5.1 Frontend (Client-Side)
* Technology Stack:
   * React: For building the user interface.
   * React Router: For client-side routing.
   * State Management: (e.g., React Context API or Redux for more complex state)
   * Styling: (e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, or Tailwind CSS for efficient styling and dark mode management)
* Component-Based Structure: The UI will be broken down into reusable components (e.g., Header, WorkoutForm, NutritionEntry, StreakDisplay, ProfileCard).
* Theming: Implement a robust theming solution to manage dark/light mode toggling globally.
* API Integration: Interact with the backend API for data fetching and submission.
5.2 Backend (Server-Side)
* Technology Stack: (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django, Ruby on Rails) - Choice to be finalized during detailed design.
* Database: (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL) - Choice to be finalized based on data structure and scalability needs.
   * Data Models: Define clear schemas for User, Workout, and NutritionEntry.
      * User: id, name, email, password_hash, join_date, current_weight, current_height, profile_picture_url, streak_count
      * Workout: id, user_id, date, time, exercises (array of objects: name, sets, reps, weight), notes
      * NutritionEntry: id, user_id, date, time, meals (array of objects: name, calories, macronutrients), notes
* RESTful API: Expose clear and well-documented API endpoints for all frontend interactions (e.g., /api/workouts, /api/nutrition, /api/users).
* Authentication & Authorization: Implement secure user authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization to protect user data.
* Data Validation: Implement server-side validation for all incoming data to ensure integrity.
5.3 Deployment
* Platform: (e.g., Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Heroku/AWS EC2/DigitalOcean for backend) - Choice to be finalized.
* CI/CD: Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
6. Data Flow and Interactions
1. User Login/Registration: Frontend sends credentials to backend, backend authenticates and returns a token.
2. Main Dashboard Load: Frontend fetches user data (including streak) from the backend.
3. Workout/Nutrition Logging: User submits data via frontend forms, which is sent to the backend API for storage.
4. History Retrieval: When a user clicks "Nutrition History" or "Exercise History," the frontend requests relevant data from the backend, which retrieves it from the database and sends it back.
5. Profile Update: User updates profile information on the frontend, which is sent to the backend for persistence.
